# Pascal's Triangle
Pascal's Triangle is a fascinating mathematical construct where each number in the triangle is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. It has many interesting properties and is commonly used in mathematics and computer science.

## Problem Description
Given an integer numRows, the task is to generate the first numRows of Pascal's Triangle and return it as a 2D list.

Example
Input: numRows = 5
Output:


[
    [1],
    [1, 1],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 3, 3, 1],
    [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]
]
Input: numRows = 1
Output:


[
    [1]
]
Implementation
The solution is implemented in Python using the generate method of the Solution class. It uses a nested loop to construct each row of the triangle, starting with the first row which contains only 1. For subsequent rows, it calculates each element by summing the two elements from the previous row. The result is then stored in a 2D list, which is returned as the final output.

Usage
To use the generate method, create an instance of the Solution class and call the method with the desired value of numRows. It will return the corresponding Pascal's Triangle.


from typing import List

class Solution:
    def generate(self, numRows: int) -> List[List[int]]:
        # Implementation details as described in the previous section

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.generate(5))
# Output: [[1], [1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [1, 3, 3, 1], [1, 4, 6, 4, 1]]

print(sol.generate(1))
# Output: [[1]]
The code is easy to use and provides the desired result for any valid input of numRows.

Feel free to use this code to generate Pascal's Triangle for any given number of rows and explore the fascinating world of combinatorics and number patterns!
